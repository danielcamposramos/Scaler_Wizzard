# Multi-Vibe Code In Chain

Daniel Ramos' Multi-Vibe Code In Chain treats every collaborator—AI or human—as a peer contributing original insight. This repository captures and executes the ideas coming from the swarm.

## Roles
- **Visionary Architect (Daniel Ramos)**: curates partner prompts, stitches contributions, ensures coherence.
- **AI Partners**: expand on each other's thoughts, propose improvements, surface risks.
- **Scaler Wizard Implementation Partner (Codex)**: only agent with repository access; translates deliberation into code and documentation.

## Collaboration Loop
1. Daniel gathers inputs from partners (ideas, code, sketches).
2. Codex materializes the agreed work inside the repo, responding with rationale and file references.
3. Daniel signs the human contract in the cockpit before execution and confirms rollback checkpoint.
4. Daniel validates with the swarm and returns new directives.
5. Iterate until the feature set and documentation meet the collective vision.

## Documentation Signals
- Every Codex update cites the files touched and highlights pending questions.
- Roadmaps live under `docs/backlog`.
- Architecture notes live under `docs/architecture`.

## Operating Principles
- Prefer transparent, modular files over monolithic specs.
- Note open decisions explicitly so the swarm can tackle them in parallel.
- Treat experiments as first-class citizens; capture hypotheses, not only conclusions.

## Next Steps for Partners
- Flesh out specialized partner perspectives (UI, training science, data ops) as separate documents.
- Provide mock data or config snippets for the upcoming prototype sprint.
